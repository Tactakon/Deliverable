# **Milestones** #

### **1. What is the minimum viable product for your team’s project? What features need to be completed to have gotten to the essence of the app idea?** ###
- Need a login and logout feature (to track users and their playlists).
- Need a database for profiles, playlists, etc.
- Create a profile.
- Create a playlist.
- Functionality to share playlist (a button).
- Be able to add music to that playlist.
- Spotify API  - we need the music for the playlists. 
- The queued song will refresh and now show as an item, implement a queue (songs will not be playing from MVP).
- The ability to remove songs from playlists (very simple and basic).

### **2. What features or additional engineering work will it take to get you to a project you’d be comfortable inviting other people to use?** ###
- The MVP points but with a more polished and user-friendly experience.
- Have a loading screen.
- Possible onboarding screen when first signing up / new user.
- Implementing and Designing for MFA for new users and log-in.
- Integrating social media for login and signup.
- Have the create a playlist function more polished and more details for the user to enter, such as playlist name & comments about the playlist.
- Design a better UI for inviting people to the playlist page, and have a cleaner look and feel. 
- The playlist owner can accept or refuse song suggestions at the time the song is requested to add.
    - i.e., a playlist owner (Tom) has shared his playlist passcode with the listener (Jerry). Jerry enters the passcode for Tom’s playlist. Jerry requests to add a song. There is a notification pop-up on Tom’s end, and he is prompted to select to add this song or deny adding this song. 
    - This is different from MVP because the MVP will add the song with the passcode and the owner of the playlist will have to manually go back and remove it rather than being prompted by a popup box.
- Search bar connected with a database finding a person’s playlist.
- Ability to like the playlist and follow the playlist owner.
- Add animations to buttons.
- Genre selection/filtering for playlists.
- Functionality to add to a shared playlist.
- Passcode function, a playlist can be modified upon passcode entry.

### **3. If you have extra time, what stretch features will you implement?** ###
- Recommendations of DJs according to the listener's preferences.
- Set up error states.
- Add the ability to generate QR codes with the DJs link.
- Location services.
- Notifications.
- AI Chatbot.
- Voice Search.
- In song requests, the ability to verify songs genre matches the set genre for a mix.
- AI Song suggestions. 
- Create a separate database for DJs (are you a listener or a DJ?) - would have to be a separate experience.

### **4. If you are behind schedule, what items on the roadmap will you de-prioritize?** ###
- Possible onboarding screen when first signing up / new user.
- Implementing and Designing for MFA for new users and log-in.
- Integrating social media for login and signup.
- Ability to like the playlist and follow the playlist owner.
- Genre selection/filtering for playlists.
- Add animations to buttons.
