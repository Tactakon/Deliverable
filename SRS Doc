# **1. Introduction**
---
## **1.1 Purpose**
---
The purpose of this document is to describe the implementation details and objectives of our upcoming collaborative DJing app - Verge.

## **1.2 Intended Audiemce**
---
The audience of this document is our team members, including Kirstyn Fagnani, Kinjal Rele, Derrick Hood, and John Bergin, as well as our instructor for CSC 4351 - Professor John Martin. 
## **1.3 Intended Use**
---
This document will allow our team to align with the work that needs to be completed with this project. With this document, we intend to refer back to it and ensure we are on task and have completed the original scope. This includes items like the design, brainstorming of features, planning durations, and measuring what can be accomplished in the amount of time we have. We will use this document to guide the future of our product while staying aligned with our initial ideas. 
## **1.4 Scope**
---
Verge is a seamless collaborative DJ experience that lets listeners control the music. DJs can instantly accept and relinquish control of the mix without missing a beat. As a listener, you can request your favorite song, and the DJ will see it. Whether you are a professional DJ, a weekend hobbyist, or just someone who enjoys good tunes, Verge lets everyone play a part in the mix.

Some features that define our product:
- Create, browse, share, and listen to playlists. 
- Your playlist can be locked or unlocked. Totally up to you what playlist you want to make public.
- If you give access to another user, they can add songs to your playlists. This requires a passcode.
- If a DJ plays live (in-person or virtually), you can quickly scan their QR code to request songs.
- As a DJ, you can set a genre before you start mixing. Songs requested that do not match the vibe will be automatically denied.

Many apps on the market allow DJs to mix electronically, but we have found none that incorporate the experience we intend to. We intend to create a space where listeners can connect with their favorite DJs easily and where DJs can share their premade playlist or their music in real time. Think of a mix between Spotify, Twitch, and Social Media. We hope that Verge will allow DJs and Listeners to have a meaningful experience on both ends. 

## **1.5 Definitions and Acronyms**
--- 
The remainder of the document will use the following conventions:
- QR Code
  : Quick Response Code
- VST
  : Virtual Studio Technology
- MFA
  : Multi-Factor Authentication

In addition:
- "Listeners" will refer to a user that listens to the DJs. This is the standard user in our application. 
- "DJs" will refer to a user that is offering their music services to the listeners.

2. Overall Description
2.1 User Needs
Verge attempts to solve four core user problems:
Listeners cannot follow and connect with their favorite DJs on a single platform that will also let them know when the DJ has dropped a new mix or are live at an in-person event. 
Simultaneously, it is difficult for new and upcoming DJs to expand their marketability and increase their listening audience. While having the ability to grow - DJs will still be able to be in control of their mix choices. 
Currently, it is difficult for listeners to request songs at live events - you have to yell over loud crowds, be turned down with requesting music, make your way to the DJ in a sea of people, and so many more unfortunate situations.
 While Spotify allows you to share playlists with others if the playlist is locked - the person it is shared with will not be able to add any music. There is no way around this other than making the said friend a contributor on the main user's end. We have worked around this with a passcode option. With the passcode shared with friends in a private playlist, they can add music and contribute to it. 
Our targeted users need an app that is more than watching a DJ live stream and more than listening to famous DJ's pre-recorded songs on a playlist. There are other ways to hear DJs mixes (Spotify, Twitch), but they do not offer a connection between DJs and their Listeners seamlessly. 
2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
This app makes 3 major assumptions:
As covid restrictions are easing up, demand for DJs at live events is increasing. 
Back-to-back DJing is becoming increasingly popular as more DJs enter the industry.  To avoid overcrowding in festivals, organizers would pair DJs together.
Many users wish the DJ would play their favorite song, but they either don't have the opportunity to speak with the DJ or are too shy to request a song in person.
Other major dependencies:
Our intent is to launch the app in the App Store and Google Play Store, which means that we have a hard dependency on Google and Apple's willingness to host our product. We do not anticipate this being a serious concern.
Spotify’s API is a key component of our project. If Spotify is not working, our app will not function properly.
There are countless tools at the disposal of a modern DJ. There are so many plugins and VST’s available that our app must offer unique functionality to make it desirable to our user base.
